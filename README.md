inspeired by this [article](https://floooh.github.io/2020/08/23/sokol-bindgen.html) uses zig to create zig bindgens for c++

`zig cc -x c++ -std=c++11 -Xclang -ast-dump=json {input_file}`


## Notes

- Avoid glue C code
- Transpiled code can leak memory (implicit destructors aren't called)
- Manual adjustments are required, specially to make bindings idiomatic and easer to read
- Meant to work with libraries that follow the *C with classes* coding style
- No Zig side inheritance, instead create bindings of a C++ implementation

## Usage

### Setup

1. make sure `zig` in your PATH, you will need the version `0.11.0-dev.3220+447a30299` (sorry about that)
2. build the project and copy the `c2z` executable from `zig-out` to your desired location
3. or just run the project using `zig build run -- ARGS`

### Running it

1. `zig build run -- my_include_file.h` or `c2z my_include_file.h`
2. use `--cargs` to pass arguments to clang this is useful to includes e.g. `zig build run -- --cargs "-I.\use_cases\msdfgen\include\" .\use_cases\msdfgen\include\core\generator-config.h`
3. modify the generated bindings until it works ;) you might need to import `cpp.zig` it is located in the src folder


## Todo

- (easy) verbose option
- (easy) `#include` -> `@import`
- (easy) better input file not found error
- (easy) resolve return of function with a aliased return type
- (easy) fail when clang ast-bump has failed, because missing headers or worng code
- default optional function args
- (hard) `if (*data++ == v) { ... }` should generate `{ data += 1; if (data.* == v) { ... } }`
- (hard) solve `UnresolvedMemberExpr`, maybe when integrating clang ast directly
- (hard) solve implicit destructors call
- (easy) handle private members, class is default private, struct default public, in code is referenced as `self.public`
- use `@compileError` for objects that couldn't be transpiled
- write layout tests
